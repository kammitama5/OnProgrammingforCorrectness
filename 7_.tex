\section{The Hoare Triple : Abort (Specific Case)}
Consider the abort command, which aborts
$\left\{Q : ? \right\}$ 
\\
\\
abort
\\
\\
$\left\{R : x > 4 \right\}$ 
\\
\\
From what state Q will the command abort finish
\\
\\
in a state where $x > 4$ is TRUE?
\\
\\
In other words
\\
\\
wp("abort", $x > 4$) = 
\\
\\
FALSE
\\
\\
Explanation:
\\
\\
The key in this is that $x > 4$ is TRUE.
\\
\\
Therefore the condition is true, and the loop continues
\\
\\
Therefore it cannot abort.

\section{The Hoare Triple : Abort (General Case)}
Homework 2.3.2.2
\\
\\
(General Case)
\\
\\
Building on the last homework, consider the general case
\\
\\
$\left\{Q : ? \right\}$
\\
\\
abort
\\
\\
$\left\{R \right\}$
\\
\\
From what state Q will the command abort finish
\\
\\
in a state where R is TRUE?
\\
\\
In other words
\\
\\
wp("abort", R) = 
\\
\\
FALSE
\\
\\
Explanation: As above, as long as R is true
\\
\\
The command abort cannot occur.
